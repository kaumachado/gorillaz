                    Noodle was originally conceptualised by Jamie Hewlett as a 17-year-old girl named Paula Cracker, 
                    but Damon Albarn noted that the character was too similar to the characters that Hewlett is typically known for drawing, 
                    and recommended that he attempt to create "something different".<br> 
                    Taking Albarn's advice, Hewlett designed an illustration of a 10-year-old Japanese girl named Noodle who is a martial arts expert.
                    In October 2016, Noodle became the global ambassador for Jaguar Racing, appearing in a short commercial advertising the company.

                    bassist for the band. 
                    Murdoc is based on Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards, Victor Frankenstein, and Creeper from Scooby-Doo.<br>
                    In particular, he was inspired by a photograph of the Rolling Stones taken in 1968 by photographer David Bailey. 
                    Once described by creator Jamie Hewlett as being the "unpleasant villain of the band".<br> Murdoc is a Satanist who is often depicted wearing an inverted cross necklace, 
                    with "Hail Satan" being a common catchphrase of his. 
                    He was created by Hewlett and Damon Albarn in 1998, with his first official appearance being Gorillaz' debut EP Tomorrow Comes Today in 2000.
